# Percyqaz.Flux

Multi-purpose rhythm game engine built on top of OpenTK

Designed so it could power both [a rhythm game client](https://github.com/YAVSRG/Interlude) and [a rhythm game chart editor](https://github.com/percyqaz/Pulse-v1) :)

## Features
- Precise audio playback/input timing (for rhythm game purposes)
- Some basics around rendering, texture loading and text rendering
- UI engine and handful of basic components

At the moment this project is specific to my particular needs and has no documentation

Someone who discovers this repo may still find it useful to have a look through it

In the future, the audio engine may be detachable allowing this to just be a general purpose game jam toolkit
